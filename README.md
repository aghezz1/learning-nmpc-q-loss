# learning-nmpc-q-loss
Imitation Learning from NMPC via acados and PyTorch

This repo will contain the implementation described in the paper:
`Imitation Learning from Nonlinear MPC via the Exact Q-Loss and its Gauss-Newton Approximation`, available [here](https://cdn.syscop.de/publications/Ghezzi2023b.pdf).

The paper will be presented in December 2023 at the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control. The code will be published within that date.
